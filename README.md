A library for image similarity indexing and searching.

> **CAUTION**: This code is proof-of-concept quality. This means:
>
>  * The API is unstable and doesnâ€™t support common use cases.
>  * The index format is unstable.
>  * It is not thread safe.
>  * Test coverage is mostly non-existant.
>  * The current fingerprinting method has known weaknesses which affect quality of results.
